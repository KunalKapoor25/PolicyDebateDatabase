# policyDebateDatabase
I implement a variety of programs to scrape various data points from policy debate results websites via the use of selenium and a spider crawling algorithm. The data included debater speaker points, pref rates of judges,
 the rate at which specific judges sat on 3 judge panels, and the average speaks that individual judges gave. The data was all compiled into a google sheet using gsSpread and Pandas.
